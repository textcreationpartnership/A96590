            <title>The discovery of mysteries: or, The plots and practices of a prevalent faction in this present Parliament. To overthrow the established religion, and the well setled government of this glorious Church, and to introduce a new framed discipline (not yet agreed upon by themselves what it shall be) to set up a new invented religion, patched together of Anabaptisticall and Brownisticall tenents, and many other new and old errors. And also, to subvert the fundamentall lawes of this famous kingdome, by devesting our King of his just rights, and unquestionable royall prerogatives, and depriving the subjects of the propriety of their goods, and the liberty of their persons; and under the name of the priviledge of Parliament, to exchange that excellent monarchicall government of this nation, into the tyrannicall government of a faction prevailing over the major part of their well-meaning brethren, to vote and order things full of all injustice, oppression and cruelty, as may appeare out of many, by these few subsequent collections of their proceedings. / By Gr.

            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

<note place="margin">Clergy, how fit to be Judges.</note> to doe the leaſt <hi>injuſtice</hi> to their perſons; ſo our love of <hi>mercy</hi> and pitty will not ſuffer us to doe any thing that ſhall tranſcend the rules of <hi>juſtice</hi> and equity; and as our inclination to <hi>mercy</hi> prohibits us to condemne the innocent, ſo our love to <hi>juſtice,</hi> and our charge to preſerve it, will not permit us to juſtifie the wicked; for the Scripture teacheth us, that <hi>he which juſtifieth the wicked, and he that condemneth the innocent,</hi> that calleth the <hi>evill</hi> good, and the <hi>good</hi> evill, that ſpareth <hi>Agag,</hi> and killeth <hi>Naboth, are both alike abominable unto the Lord.</hi>

               </p>
               <p>Yet it may be, he was (which in truth I cannot imagine) as the Philoſopher ſaith of <hi>Marcus Antonius,</hi> a man of that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition, that his <hi>vices</hi> did equalize, if not exceed his <hi>vertues,</hi> and his-offences <hi>cloud</hi> all his graces, and obſcure all his glory; and as the <hi>ſaving</hi> of one mans life cannot ſave him from <hi>ſuffering,</hi> that doth unjuſtly put another man to death, ſo the <hi>rareſt</hi> vertues cannot <hi>juſtifie</hi> the man that committeth ſo <hi>many</hi> horrible offences,
<note place="margin">How a male<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factor may be unjuſtly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned.</note> as his accuſers conceived this man did; to which it may be well replyed, that a <hi>notorious</hi> malefactor (though I apply not this to him) may be <hi>unjuſtly</hi> condemned;

               <p>And this cannot be done without a great deale of money; which moneys though the <hi>Parliament</hi> ſhould grant them, (as we are moſt willing to doe, to free your Majeſtie from theſe <hi>gueſts,</hi> and to prevent the <hi>dangers</hi> of an inteſtine warre) yet they cannot <hi>ſuddenly</hi> be levyed and collected, as the <hi>times</hi> and occaſions now required; therefore it muſt be <hi>borrowed</hi> to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply our <hi>preſent</hi> neceſſities, and <hi>lenders</hi> we ſhall finde none, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept we can ſhew them a <hi>way</hi> how they ſhall be repaid againe; and the <hi>experience</hi> we have lately had in theſe <hi>latter</hi> yeares, of ſo many <hi>Parliaments</hi> ſo <hi>unhappily</hi> ſuddenly diſſolved, puts us out of all hope to finde <hi>any</hi> way to ſecure their debts, except your Majeſtie will paſſe an <hi>Act,</hi> (for as yet they durſt not ſay they needed not His aſſent to what they did) that <hi>this</hi> Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment ſhall not be <hi>diſſolved,</hi> untill it be agreed upon by the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent of both Houſes.</p>
               <p>This and the like were their <hi>faire</hi> pretences,
<note place="margin">How the King was ſeduced by their pretences.</note> like the <hi>Syrens</hi> voices, very <hi>ſweet,</hi> and very good; and the <hi>good</hi> King that ever <hi>ſpake</hi> as he thought, could not thinke that His <hi>great</hi> Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell, whom He <hi>truſted</hi> with all the affaires of His Kingdome, meant any <hi>otherwiſe</hi> then they ſaid, or looked any <hi>further</hi> then they ſhewed Him; Hee never dream'd that they intended to have an <hi>everlaſting</hi> Parliament, and ſo perfidiouſly to over-reach both the King and the Kingdome.</p>
               <p>But though our <hi>gracious</hi> King (being not ſo much verſed with the diſſembling <hi>ſubtilty</hi> and ſerpentine windings of wicked hypocrites, that are to be removed from the King, and expelled out of His houſe) ſuppoſed all them to meane <hi>ſyncere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,</hi> and to deale <hi>fairely</hi> as they ſeemed to doe; yet I doe ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mire that the <hi>wiſedome</hi> of the Kings Councell, (but that they, which as the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>are not ignorant of the devices of Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan,</hi> are not permitted by theſe men to be of His Councell) could not eſpie what miſchiefe might <hi>lurke</hi> under this faire ſhade, or what might be the <hi>conſequences</hi> of ſuch a Parliament,

               <p>But to ſatisfie any <hi>ſenſible</hi> man in this point, I would crave the reſolution of theſe two Queſtions:</p>

               <p n="2">2. Whether the <hi>King</hi> ſhould not protect his Subjects that are <hi>Papists</hi> in all their dangers, ſo farre as by the Law he ought to do it;
<note place="margin">1. All Papiſts bound to aſſiſt their King.</note> and accept of their ſervice when himſelfe is invi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roned with dangers?</p>
               <p>For firſt, I believe there is <hi>no</hi> Law that <hi>inhibiteth</hi> a <hi>Papist</hi> to ſerve his King againſt a <hi>Rebellion,</hi> or to ride poſt, to tell the King of a Deſigne to murder Him, or any other <hi>intended</hi> Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon againſt Him; or being preſent, to take away a weapon from that man that attempted to kill the King; becauſe his not comming to <hi>Church</hi> doth not exempt him from his <hi>Allea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance,</hi> or diſcharge him of his <hi>dutie</hi> and ſervice unto the King and therefore if a Fleet from <hi>France</hi> or <hi>Spain</hi> or any other <hi>for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reigne</hi> part ſhould invade us, or any Rebellion at <hi>home</hi> ſhould riſe againſt his Soveraigne, and ſeck to <hi>destroy</hi> thoſe Lawes and Liberties whereof himſelfe and his Poſteritie hath as good an intereſt as any other Subject, I ſay, he is bound by all Lawes to <hi>aſſist</hi> his King, and to do his beſt endeavour, both with his <hi>purſe</hi> and in his <hi>perſon,</hi> not onely to <hi>oppoſe</hi> that externall Invaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, but alſo to <hi>ſubdue,</hi> as well that home-bred Rebellion, as the forreigne Invaſion.</p>

I cannot underſtand. And yet, for the <hi>goodly</hi> companie of <hi>Papists</hi> which his Majeſtie entertaineth in all his Armies, they cannot all make up ſo much as one <hi>good</hi> Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giment, as an Officer in his Majeſties Armie <hi>confidently</hi> af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmeth; but it will ſerve their turne to <hi>taxe</hi> the King, to lay imputations upon him, even the <hi>very</hi> things that belong unto themſelves (as the whole ſumme of thoſe things that are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed in <hi>Englands Petition to their King,

               <p>And to make the world believe how <hi>juſtly</hi> and ſufficiently <hi>legall</hi> they could doe this, they made another ordinance for the inhabitants of the Counties of <hi>North-hampton, Rutland, Derby, &amp;c.</hi> to pay the twentieth part, and to be <hi>aſſeſſed</hi> by the Aſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſors that they name, in imitation of the Statute lately made for the foure hundred thouſand pound: and it is more than <hi>proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,</hi> that this proceeding is but the <hi>praeludium</hi> of the like exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction to be extended, when their <hi>need</hi> requireth, to all the <hi>o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther</hi> parts of the Kingdome; which is a moſt miſerable courſe, and injuſtice not to be <hi>paralleld,</hi> to caſt themſelves, into a <hi>ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity</hi> of getting money, to maintaine an <hi>impious</hi> warre againſt their King, and then out of that neceſſity to <hi>compell</hi> their fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low ſubjects, and thoſe <hi>peaceable</hi> men (that doe <hi>abominate</hi> this war,) to maintaine the ſame (yea, and to <hi>fight</hi> in the ſame, to <hi>kill</hi> men againſt their conſciences,) in deſpite of their teeth; or if they <hi>refuſe</hi> to doe it, to <hi>ſond,</hi> or at leaſt to permit, a party of Horſe, Dragooneers, and other ſtrength to goe to fetch their <hi>Money,</hi> Plate or other goods, as if they were the goods of the <hi>deadly</hi> enemies of the Common wealth; and this for <hi>none</hi> o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther reaſon, but for that the owners thereof are <hi>good</hi> Subjects to the King, and not well affected to their <hi>uniuſt,</hi> and ungod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly proceedings.</p>

               <p>And though ſome Kings did <hi>graciously</hi> yeeld and by their <hi>voluntary</hi> oathes, for themſelves and their ſucceſſors, binde themſelves many times, to <hi>ſtricter</hi> limits, then were <hi>abſolutely</hi> requiſite, as <hi>William Rufus,</hi> King <hi>Stephen, Henry</hi> the fourth, <hi>Richard</hi> the third, and the like, granted many <hi>priviledges,</hi> per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps to gaine the favour of their Subjects, againſt thoſe which likely had a better title to the Crowne than themſelves: or, it may be, to ſatisfie their people, as the guerdon or com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſation for the ſufferance of ſome fore-paſſed grievances, as <hi>Henry</hi> the firſt, <hi>Edward</hi> the ſecond, <hi>Richard</hi> the ſecond, and the like: yet theſe <hi>limitations,</hi> being agreeable to equity, and conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtent with Royalty, and not forcibly extracted, ought in all truth and reaſon to be obſerved by them.

               <p>But though they have thus yeelded, to <hi>make</hi> no lawes, nor to repeale any lawes without them; yet this <hi>voluntary</hi> conceſſion of ſo much grace unto the people, doth no wayes tranſlate the <hi>legislative</hi> power from the King unto his aſſiſtants, but that it is <hi>formaliter</hi> and <hi>ſubiectivè</hi> ſtill in the King, and not in them; elſe would the government of this Kingdome bee an <hi>Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtocracy,</hi> or <hi>Democracy,</hi> and not a <hi>Monarchy;</hi> becauſe the ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preame power of making and repealing Lawes, and <hi>govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> or judging deciſively according to thoſe lawes,

               <p>And therefore for the Lords and Commons to make <hi>Orders</hi> and Ordinances <hi>without</hi> the King, and in <hi>oppoſition</hi> to the King, is a meere <hi>uſurpation</hi> of the Regall power, a <hi>nullifying</hi> of the Kings power, and a making of the <hi>Royall</hi> aſſent, which hereto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore gave <hi>life</hi> to every law, to be an <hi>empty</hi> piece of formality, which is indeed, an intolerable <hi>arrogancy</hi> in the contrivers of theſe Orders and the makers of theſe Ordinances, a monſtrous <hi>abuſe</hi> of the Subjects, and a plaine making of our good King
